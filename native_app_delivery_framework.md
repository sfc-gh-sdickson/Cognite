# Snowflake Native App Delivery Framework
## Cognite Data Integration Solution

---

## Executive Summary

This framework outlines the step-by-step approach to deliver a Snowflake Native App that enables seamless data integration from customer Snowflake environments to Cognite's Knowledge Graph, eliminating the current multi-step ETL process.

**Goal**: Replace the problematic pipeline (Snowflake → Extractor → Raw Storage → Spark Transform → Knowledge Graph) with a streamlined native app solution.
