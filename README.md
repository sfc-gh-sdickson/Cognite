# Cognite-Snowflake Partnership Project

<img src="Snowflake_Logo.svg" width="200">

## Overview

This repository contains the strategic planning documents, architectural diagrams, and implementation framework for the Cognite-Snowflake data integration partnership. The project aims to create seamless data sharing capabilities between Cognite's Data Fusion platform and Snowflake's cloud data platform through innovative native app solutions.

## Project Background

Based on a comprehensive partnership meeting held in September 2025, this project addresses the critical need for efficient data integration between Cognite's industrial knowledge graph and customer data residing in Snowflake environments. The solution eliminates complex ETL pipelines and enables true "zero-copy" data sharing through modern cloud-native approaches.
