# Cognite-Snowflake Partnership Meeting Analysis

## Meeting Overview
**Date**: September 25, 2025  
**Duration**: ~1 hour 19 minutes  
**Participants**:
- **Cognite**: Hal (Strategy), Ryan, Leanna
- **Snowflake**: Stephen, Venkat

## Key Objectives
1. Define technical architecture for data sharing between Cognite and Snowflake
2. Work toward a prototype for upcoming conference presentation
3. Address Exxon's requirements as a driving customer
4. Establish partnership announcement strategy

## Two Core Data Sharing Patterns Discussed

### Pattern 1: Cognite â†’ Snowflake (AGREED)
**Goal**: Expose Cognite knowledge graph data to Snowflake users without data duplication

**Architecture**:
- Cognite exposes data as Iceberg tables
- Available through Polaris catalog in Snowflake
- Enables "zero copy" data sharing
- Supports both structured and unstructured data (with file API references)

**Status**: âœ… **CONSENSUS REACHED** - This pattern is agreed upon and feasible

### Pattern 2: Snowflake â†’ Cognite (COMPLEX)
**Goal**: Enrich Cognite knowledge graph with Snowflake data without traditional ETL

**Current State** (problematic):
```
Snowflake â†’ Extractor â†’ Raw Storage â†’ Spark Transformations â†’ Knowledge Graph
```

**Proposed New Approaches**:

**Option A - Native App (Preferred)**:
```
Snowflake â†’ Native App (data prep) â†’ Direct to Knowledge Graph/Iceberg Tables
```

**Option B - Direct Connection**:
```
Snowflake â†’ Managed Spark (direct read) â†’ Knowledge Graph
```

## Technical Architecture Details

### Iceberg + Polaris Catalog Approach
- **Benefits**: True zero-copy, unified catalog, direct access for both parties
- **Implementation**: Customer-managed Iceberg environment with Polaris catalog
- **Data Types Supported**:
  - Structured data â†’ Direct Iceberg tables
  - Unstructured data â†’ Metadata in Iceberg + File API references
  - Time series â†’ Iceberg format (not optimized but workable)
  - 3D models â†’ References + metadata

### Native App Strategy
- **User Experience**: Customer selects tables â†’ App runs transformations â†’ Outputs to Knowledge Graph/Iceberg
- **Compute**: Runs in customer's Snowflake account (Snowpark/Python)
- **Benefits**: 
  - IP protection (code not visible to customer)
  - Hidden data sharing capabilities
  - Customer controls throttling and batching
  - Real-time data updates

## Strategic Considerations

### Cognite's Multi-Platform Challenge
- Must also work with Databricks, Microsoft Fabric
- Cannot build platform-specific solutions for each vendor
- Needs SaaS product approach, not services
- Limited engineering resources

### Snowflake's Long-term Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Get Cognite to build native app (development engagement)
- **Phase 2**: Prove Snowflake is faster/cheaper than Spark clusters
- **Phase 3**: Cognite abandons Fabric/Databricks for Snowflake
- **Phase 4**: Full platform consolidation

## Action Items & Next Steps

### Immediate (Conference Prep)
1. **Hal**: Engage Fredrik (Head of Data Integration) and technical architect
2. **Hal**: Connect with Trygve (Partner lead) for marketing coordination
3. **Stephen/Venkat**: Schedule technical deep-dive on Spark code transformation
4. **Marketing**: Draft partnership announcement for conference

### Technical Development
1. **Assessment**: Understand current Spark transformation complexity
2. **Prototype**: Build native app proof-of-concept
3. **Development Environment**: Set up Snowflake account for Cognite team
4. **Architecture**: Finalize authentication and security patterns

### Customer Engagement
1. **Exxon**: Present architectural approach and get validation
2. **Conference**: Joint customer conversations during event
3. **Press Release**: Coordinate announcement with customer quotes

## Key Quotes & Insights

### On Partnership Strategy
> "We want to try to move towards building a prototype as soon as possible... working towards a press release, working towards maybe having something to show at your conference is really kind of what our North Star is." - Ryan

### On Technical Approach
> "The point is seldom actual zero copy. The point is, very often, I don't want to manage many data pipelines point to point. I don't want to manage multiple sources of truth, and I don't want to pay for it twice." - Hal

### On Business Model Alignment
> "What's good about our business model. Since that we were not cannibalizing each other, like I wouldn't be happier than you to take all the compute things in the world and have the customer pay for it... I have a licensed business model not a consumption" - Hal

## Risks & Challenges

### Technical Risks
- Native app doesn't currently support Spark (must use Python/Snowpark)
- API throttling challenges at scale
- Authentication and security complexity
- Multi-platform compatibility requirements

### Business Risks
- Significant development investment required
- Timeline pressure from conference and Exxon
- Competing priorities on Cognite roadmap
- Level of effort unknown until Spark code analysis

### Strategic Risks
- Cognite's reluctance to build platform-specific solutions
- Snowflake's long-term play may not align with Cognite's platform strategy
- Customer expectations vs. delivery timeline

## Success Metrics

### Short-term (Conference)
- Partnership announcement completed
- Technical architecture agreed upon
- Exxon validation obtained
- Development roadmap established

### Medium-term (6 months)
- Native app prototype functional
- Customer beta testing initiated
- Marketplace deployment ready
- Joint customer wins documented

### Long-term (12+ months)
- Full production deployment
- Multiple customer implementations
- Expanded partnership scope
- Platform consolidation discussions

## Conference Positioning

### Announcement Strategy
- Focus on "seamless integration" and "better customer experience"
- Emphasize speed to market and joint innovation
- Include customer validation (Exxon on stage discussing open ecosystem)
- Position as first step in broader partnership roadmap

### Demo Potential
- Live data transformation from Snowflake to Cognite
- Natural language querying of combined structured/unstructured data
- Agent-based interactions with industrial data
- Real-time operational insights

## Financial Considerations

### Development Investment
- Snowflake: Innovation credits available (~$100K budget)
- Cognite: Engineering resource allocation needed
- Joint development model proposed
- ROI tied to customer acquisition and retention

### Revenue Model
- Cognite: License-based, not consumption
- Snowflake: Compute consumption growth
- Shared value creation through customer success
- Potential for expanded partnership scope
